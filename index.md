# SQL projects and source control integration for SQL in Fabric, Azure SQL, and SQL Server

Permalink: [https://aka.ms/sql-devops-workshop](https://aka.ms/sql-devops-workshop)

## Summary

This workshop is a deep dive on database DevOps centered on the SQL database projects format, where you will learn practical techniques for managing database changes whether your workload is operational, analytical, or somewhere in between. Our exploration begins with the foundational CI/CD capabilities for SQL projects, where you can ensure no matter how a database is developed it is in source control and can be verified before deployments to one or more environments. The same shared SQL projects format applies to the whole Microsoft SQL family, so we'll examine the advantages and special capabilities to understand when implementing DevOps practices for Fabric SQL, Azure SQL, or SQL Server. We conclude our workshop with some special topics at the core of good data DevOps practices, including security management, static data management, and coordinating changes with other workloads.

## Workshop labs

- [Lab 0: Setup](LAB0/)
- [Lab 1: Participants configure a simple CI/CD pipelines for a sample SQL project](LAB1/)
- [Lab 2: Participants deploy SQL projects to different platforms](LAB2/)
- [Lab 3: Participants implement advanced DevOps practices in their SQL projects](LAB3/)
- [Lab 4: Troubleshooting and Optimizing DevOps Workflows](LAB4/)

### [Lab 1](LAB1/): Participants configure a simple CI/CD pipelines for a sample SQL project

- 1.1: Create a project from an existing database
- 1.2: Create a pipeline to publish the project to the database
- 1.3: Create a pipeline to build the project and run code analysis
- 1.4: Deploy our changes to the database

### [Lab 2](LAB2/): Participants deploy SQL projects to different platforms

- 2.0: Update your local repository from GitHub
- 2.1: Create a pipeline for SQL Server 2022
- 2.2: Create a SQL database in Fabric and use source control integration

### [Lab 3](LAB3/): Participants implement advanced DevOps practices in their SQL projects

- 3.1: Static data management through a post-deployment script
- 3.2: Deploy script and environment approvals
- 3.3: Deploy report and summarizing dangers

### [Lab 4](LAB4/): Troubleshooting and Optimizing DevOps Workflows

- 4.1: Creating a rollback point when the deployment is successful
- 4.2: Incorporating data cleaning pre-deployment scripts
- 4.3: Source control for a rogue database
